# AWS No Root User For Everyday Tasks

## What it does

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of authentication assurance beyond traditional credentials. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to the AWS Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their physical or virtual MFA token. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a console password, and this policy checks for users that have a console password but do *not* have MFA enabled.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to generate and examine a credential report. When users are found that have a console password but do not have MFA enabled, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected users.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
